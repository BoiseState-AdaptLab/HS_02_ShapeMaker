# ShapeMaker

In this lab you write functions to create different shapes: rectangles, triangles, and circles.  You will then use your functions to create a picture. 

## Challenge 1

- [ ] Implement the following functions 

	* drawRectangle -- this is done for you, but it isn't quite right!!
	* drawTriangle
	* drawCircle

- [ ] Practice calling your functions using different parameters to make sure they work correctly

## Challenge 2

- [ ] Modify the _drawRectangle_ function your wrote so that you can add text to the rectangle in a different part of your program.  Do this by adding a _return_ statement to return the _rectangle_ variable.  

- [ ] Declare a new variable (call it whatever you want).  Then call _drawRectangle_ and assign it to this new variable (see the code snippet below).  Add text to  your rectangle. 

```
var myRectangle = drawRectangle(200, 10, 10);
```

- [ ] Modify the _drawCircle_ function your wrote so that you can change the background color of the circle in a different part of your program.  Do this by adding a _return_ statement to return the circle variable. 

- [ ] Declare a new variable as before, then call _drawCircle_ and assign it to this new variable.  Use the _backgroundColor_ property to change the background color of the circle. 

## Challenge 3

- [ ] Create triangles with different colors by replacing null with a color when you call _makeTriangle_.  For example, the following code snippet would draw a pink triangle, 

drawTriangle(100, 200, 200, "transparent", "transparent", "transparent", "pink");

## Challenge 4

- [ ] Create a picture of a "Winter Scene" using the functions you wrote.  Your final image should incorporate at least 10 different elements and clearly resemble an image.
